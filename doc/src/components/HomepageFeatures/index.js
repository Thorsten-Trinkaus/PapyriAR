// This project explores the intersection of ancient history and modern technology by using augmented reality to visualize the transcripts of papyri over the original artifacts.
// Leveraging AR.js, a lightweight AR library, we manage to run the entire project directly in the browser as a static website. This should enable the maximum amount of people and devices to use the papyrus magnifier glass.  
// We offer detailed guides for user and developer. This should allow everybody to easily understand, use and interact with our project. We also provide a step by step explanation for any developer wanting to further build upon our foundation.
